    1. paricle is WORTH-LEARNING
      --> how to add force on particles
      --> how to add light on particles
      --> how to form a different size of scene
    2. the shooting part is GOOD
    3. switching particle part in code WORTH-LEARNING
      --> using private int as index, but load the prefab_array, i wonder where are those perfabs located
    4. the scene lighting changing is INSPRIING
    5. the camera 2 side split is WORTH-LEARNING
      --> can utilize on 2 player mode
